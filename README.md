Rubyish (Pronounced rubbish)
====

A ruby-ish shell.  Inspired by windows PowerShell. I liked the idea behind windows powershell, but I find myself using linux/mac more and more these days. I love ruby's block syntax and think it would be incredibly helpful in a day to day shell environment.

I'm creating this with the following goals in mind.

# I've heard, and kind of experienced that Ruby/Rails development sucks in windows. I'd like to make this a full fledged development shell that windows users could use to develop Rails apps.
# I want to create a Powershell "equivilant" that I can use on any platform. Ideally rubyish would be my day to day shell regardless of if I'm on a Mac/Linux/Windows machine.
# Something fun for myself, and others to work on and improve. So, we should be able to:
## Add our own commands, written in Ruby, included in a number of conventional and configurable locations.
## Contribute to the project. Wrote a command that replaces a cool bash command you like? Submit it, and it might get added to the core!

Welcome to accepting contributers, so if you like the idea of the project, send me a message and we'll talk about the direction it's going.

Cheers.
